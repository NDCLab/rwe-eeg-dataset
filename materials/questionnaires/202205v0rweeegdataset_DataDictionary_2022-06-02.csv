You may be asked to perform some tasks while under social observation, and you may be asked to observe another participant performing similar tasks.

We might contact you for future studies. Future studies will involve a consent process (like this one). You can request that your contact information be deleted at any time.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Not all individuals that participate in this study will complete the same questionnaires and tasks. Similarly, not all individuals will have EEG recorded during this study. For this reason, the total amount of time that it takes to complete this study is not the same for all participants.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A specific set of tasks has been assigned for you to participate in, including whether EEG will be collected. Based on how long each of these tasks take, you have been informed how long the total assessment is expected to take today. In the following “Procedures” section, we note the maximum amount of time that each portion of the study will take. However, because you will only complete a subset of these tasks, the total amount of time for the study will not exceed what was communicated to you when you signed up for this study (between 1-5 hours).</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>PROCEDURES</strong></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to complete surveys over the internet. The surveys will assess personal information, cognitive abilities, social abilities, and mental health. This portion of the study will take no more than one hour. Based on which tasks have been assigned for you to participate in, we may also ask you to do one or more of the following things, during which we may record audio and video:</span></p> <ol> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Complete one or more computer-based games that ask you to respond to on-screen items of different shapes, sizes, or words. Instructions will be provided on how to play each game before it starts. You will respond to a series of items for each game. This portion of the study will take no more than 1.5 hours.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Engage in one or more performance tasks that involve physical movement or hand-eye coordination (like tossing a ball into a basket), or vocal responses (like reading a text aloud). Instructions will be provided on how to perform each task. This portion of the study will take no more than 1.5 hours.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Engage in one or more social interactions, like giving a short speech or having a conversation with another person. This portion of the study will take no more than 1.5 hours.</span></li> </ol> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You might complete these tasks alone, or you might be asked to complete these tasks while being observed by an experimenter or another participant. Similarly, you may be asked to observe another participant completing similar tasks during your visit today. If you are asked to observe another participant, this portion of the study will take no more than 1.5 hours.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">During these tasks, we may record electrical activity in your brain with an electroencephalography (EEG) device; we may also record audio and video. You can stop at any time.    </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For the EEG, we will place a cap or net on your head that contains electrodes to record your brain activity. These electrodes sit on top of your scalp; they do not hurt you. To ensure that the electrodes get a clear signal, we will apply either a saline gel or saline solution to each electrode and your scalp. We will also slightly abrade the scalp at the location of the electrodes, in order to remove dead skin, oil, etc. and ensure a clear signal. Although the electrodes do not hurt you, the process of putting on the cap can be a little uncomfortable for some. However, you may stop at any time. Applying and removing the EEG will take no more than 1 hour. Before we apply the cap, we will ask you to brush/comb your hair about ten times; this helps remove dead skin cells so that we get a better connection between each electrode and your scalp. If you are not comfortable brushing/combing your hair before we apply the cap, or if you wear your hair in a braided style and are not comfortable removing this hairstyle for the visit, you do not have to.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This EEG is done for research purposes only. The EEG recording being done is designed to answer research questions, not to medically examine you or provide a clinical diagnosis. The EEG recording is not a substitute for one a physician would order. It may not show problems that would be picked up by a medical EEG test. The researchers are not professionally qualified to act as your medical provider. However, if we see something unusual in your EEG data, we will inform you so that you can obtain appropriate follow-up evaluation by your physician. Any follow-up evaluation or treatment that you seek will be at your own expense. Upon your written request, Dr. Buzzell will provide you with a copy of your EEG data. You must submit your request in writing, including the date and your signature. You will receive a copy of your data within one week of submitting such a written request. Recordings will not be made available to other parties, only to you. You may then provide the recording to other parties (such as your physician).</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We may contact you for future studies. You can decline future studies. You can request that your contact information be deleted at any time.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS</strong></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The study has the following possible risks to you. You might feel some slight discomfort when performing the tasks. You might feel slightly anxious or upset when responding to the surveys about thoughts and feelings, mental health, and sexual behavior. You may feel slight discomfort from the net/cap that we will place on your head. However, any such discomfort from the tasks, surveys, or net/cap is likely to be minimal and short-lived. Your eyes may get fatigued from looking at a computer screen, especially if you wear contacts, in which case you may be offered sterile, single-use eyedrops; you can choose whether you want to use any eyedrops provided or not. There is a potential for a breach of confidentiality; however, this is very unlikely as many protocols have been put in place to minimize this possibility and protect your data.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>BENEFITS</strong></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This study does not provide any direct benefits to you.

This can be done without additional informed consent from you or your legally authorized representative.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you participate in additional studies, the data will be linked via an anonymous number. This will allow the data to be analyzed together, but not identify you in any way.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Anonymized data from this study may be made publicly accessible. For example, anonymized data may be posted to the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/), the OpenNeuro project (<a href=""https://openneuro.org/"">https://openneuro.org/</a>), or a similar, publicly-available repository. This data may include survey responses, task performance, EEG data, and analyses or information supplied by researchers.
