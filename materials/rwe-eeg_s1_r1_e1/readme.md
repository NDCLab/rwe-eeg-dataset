# RWE-EEG_S1_R1_E1 (DARWIN)

This folder contains the reading aloud task with 8 Darwin passages used for pilot data collection in May 2022.  The pilot participants saw the version under commit `705c9476b71c7edf83c356f7c4af5849a813c386`.

For future data collection, the following changes are planned:
* add a practice screen (pilot participants used the first instruction screen for practice)
* shift from keyboard to button box for challenge question responses

Note also that "The day rose" passage was rendered strangely in the PsychoPy output files during pilot data collection, simply shifting all outputs by several columns.  It seems likely that this is related to the quotation marks within the passage, although other passages with internal quotation marks were not similarly affected.
