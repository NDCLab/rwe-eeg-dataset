# RWE-EEG_S1_R1_E1 (DARWIN)

This folder contains the reading aloud task with 8 Darwin passages used for pilot data collection in May 2022.  The pilot participants saw the version under commit `705c9476b71c7edf83c356f7c4af5849a813c386`.

For future data collection, the following changes are planned:
* add a practice screen (pilot participants used the first instruction screen for practice)
* shift from keyboard to button box for challenge question responses

Note also that "The day rose" passage was rendered strangely in the PsychoPy output files during pilot data collection, simply shifting all outputs by several columns.  This appears to be due to the combination of quotation marks ("el famoso Corcovado") and apostrophes (beholder's) in the passage, and should be addressed prior to any future data collection.
