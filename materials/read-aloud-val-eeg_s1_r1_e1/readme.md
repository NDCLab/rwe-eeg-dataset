# READ-ALOUD-VAL-EEG_S1_R1_E1 (VALENCE)

This folder contains the reading aloud task with 20 Valence passages used for pilot data collection in May 2022.  The pilot participants saw the version under commit `TBD`.

For future data collection, the following changes are planned:
* add a practice screen (pilot participants used the first instruction screen for practice)
* shift from keyboard to button box for challenge question responses
