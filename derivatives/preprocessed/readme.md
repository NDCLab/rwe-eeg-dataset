# Preprocessed Derivatives

### Instructions
Preprocessed versions of the data are stored in this folder. Note that any additional processing should not be included in this repository and, instead, should be maintained in the `derivatives/` folder of an associated analysis repository.

**Note:** This folder is explicitly untracked in this repo's .gitignore file because data files are too large to be stored on GitHub.
