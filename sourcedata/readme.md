# Source Data

### Instructions
**If pulling data from a public repository**

Copy (via a script) the repository directly here, in the exact same format, naming conventions and folder structure as it appears in the public folder from which it was copied.  Delete the "raw" and "checked" subfolders. Include the script used to copy the data in the `code/` folder of this repository.

**If collecting new data**

Data will be placed in the "raw" and "checked" subfolders provided.

**If correcting erroneous data**

1. Move the original dataset into a dated folder. This date should be the date of the last update to the **original** (uncorrected) dataset.  For instance: 2021-01-01.

2. Create a new dated folder with today's date. Place the corrected data inside this folder.

3. Add a readme file to the new folder (today's date) outlining the error found and how it was corrected.

4. Notify all individuals who are known to have used the dataset for analyses, so that they may re-run their code on the corrected data and re-check their results.

**Note:** This folder is explicitly untracked in this repo's .gitignore file because data files are too large to be stored on GitHub.
