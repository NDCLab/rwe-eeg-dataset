# Data Monitoring

### Instructions
This folder contains:
* **data-monitoring-protocol.md**: A description of what will be monitored and how.
* **data-monitoring-log.md**: A log of actual data monitoring activities undertaken.
* **postprocessing-check/**: Scripts for testing future post-processing. Note that code is being placed here, not in “code/” because this is ad-hoc code used for checking data, not formal code used to reformat/preprocess data. Actual postprocessing code and outputs must be placed in the associated analysis repository.
* **results-check/**: Scripts, statistics, and visualizations for testing future outputs. Note that code is being placed here, not in “code/” because this is ad-hoc code used for checking data, not formal code used to reformat/preprocess data. Actual results code and outputs must be placed in the associated analysis repository.
